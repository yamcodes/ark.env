# Thanks / Inspiration

I'd like to thank the following projects and people for their help and inspiration:

- [znv](https://github.com/lostfictions/znv) - Basically `ark.env` but for [Zod](https://zod.dev/). Major inspiration for this project.
- [ArkType](https://arktype.dev/) - `ark.env` is here thanks to the brilliance of ArkType. If you somehow haven't already, please check it out. Seriously, it's amazing!
- [wobsoriano/bun-lib-starter](https://github.com/wobsoriano/bun-lib-starter) - This Bun package starter allowed me to get up and running quickly.

Thank you üôè
