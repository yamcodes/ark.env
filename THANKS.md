# Thanks / Inspiration

I'd like to thank the following projects and people for their help and inspiration:

- [ArkType](https://arktype.dev/) - ArkEnv is here thanks to the brilliance of ArkType. If you somehow haven't already, please check it out. Seriously, it's amazing! Also, [David Blass](https://github.com/ssalbdivad) (the creator of ArkType) is a legend.
- [znv](https://github.com/lostfictions/znv) - Basically ArkEnv but for [Zod](https://zod.dev/). The initial inspiration for this project.
- [vite-plugin-validate-env](https://github.com/Julien-R44/vite-plugin-validate-env) - Inspiration for the Vite plugin.
- [T3 Env](https://env.t3.gg/) - Inspiration for the API. These guys are doing a lot of stuff right. For a platform-agnostic solution, you can't go wrong with T3 Env. Also, shout out to [Theo Browne](https://github.com/t3dotgg) for being a major inspiration for devs on YouTube.

Thank you üôè
