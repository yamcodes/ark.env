# Changesets

This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the Changesets repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

There is a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[the Changesets documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md).
